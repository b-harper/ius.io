## About

IUS is a community project that provides RPM packages for newer versions of
select software for Enterprise Linux distributions.

<a name="project_goals"></a>
## Project Goals

* Create high quality RPM packages for Red HatÂ® Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and
  CentOS.
* Promptly release updated RPM packages once new versions are released by the
  upstream developers.
* No automatic replacement of stock RPM packages.

## Contact Us

Most of our development is done in [GitHub][2], so that is the best way to
reach us.  Problems with a specific package should be reported as issues in the
appropriate repository under the [iuscommunity-pkg][3] organization.  Several
other repositories exist under the [iuscommunity][4] organization for various
other things, such as [this website][5] or our [new package wishlist][6].

Other contact methods:

* `#iuscommunity` on [freenode][7]
* [general mailing list][8]
* [development mailing list][9]
